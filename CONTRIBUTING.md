## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork the repository on GitHub
   # Clone your fork locally
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/glping.git
   cd glping
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install development dependencies
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Environment Setup
1. Copy the example configuration:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   ```

2. Configure your GitLab instance settings in `config.yaml`

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python -m glping --dev
   ```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_specific_file.py

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run notification stacking tests
make test-stacking
```

## Making Changes

### Branch Strategy
1. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-fix-name
   ```

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Commit Messages
Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat(notifier): add macOS notification stacking support
fix(api): handle rate limiting errors gracefully
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

## Testing

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for all new features

- Use pytest for testing
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error cases

### Test Coverage
- Aim for high test coverage
- Focus on critical paths
- Don't test implementation details
- Test user-facing behavior
